# reclaim-sdk-fixed - Unofficial fixed Python SDK for Reclaim.ai

## Fixed version
This is a temporary fixed version of the unofficial Reclaim.ai Python SDK. The original project appears to be unmaintained, and some critical issues have emerged. This version addresses these issues while maintaining compatibility with the current Reclaim.ai API. Once the original project resumes maintenance, this package will be deprecated in favor of the official SDK.

The main fixes include:
- Added further fields to Task [#8](https://github.com/labiso-gmbh/reclaim-sdk/pull/8)
- Fixed incorrect time format in log_work [#9](ttps://github.com/labiso-gmbh/reclaim-sdk/pull/9)

## Python SDK
reclaim-sdk is a Python SDK designed for the Reclaim.ai API. It offers a straightforward and developer-friendly interface for managing tasks within Reclaim.ai. Please note that this SDK is not officially affiliated with Reclaim.ai and has been reverse-engineered from the Reclaim.ai web app, as well as utilizing the Swagger Spec provided by AJ from Reclaim.ai =>[Swagger Spec](https://api.app.reclaim.ai/swagger/reclaim-api-0.1.yml). Consequently, there may be bugs, and the API is subject to change without notice. Version stability is not guaranteed.

## Features
At present, reclaim-sdk exclusively supports task management. Its primary function is to integrate various tools with Reclaim.ai, enabling the efficient handling of tasks from project management, calendars, and similar applications within Reclaim.ai. For other features, such as managing habits or custom hours, users should utilize the Reclaim.ai web app directly.

## Installation
To install reclaim-sdk, simply run the following command:
```bash
pip install reclaim-sdk-fixed
```

## Configuration
You can get an API key from [here](https://app.reclaim.ai/settings/developer).

There are now two ways to configure the SDK with your API key:

1. Using the `RECLAIM_TOKEN` environment variable:
   ```python
   import os
   os.environ["RECLAIM_TOKEN"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

2. Using the new `configure` method:
   ```python
   from reclaim_sdk.client import ReclaimClient
   
   ReclaimClient.configure(token="YOUR_API_KEY")
   ```

The `configure` method allows you to set up the client with your API token (and optionally a base URL) at any point in your code before making API calls.

## Usage
The SDK uses Pydantic models for better type checking and data validation. Please refer to code examples below:

- [Task Management](/examples/task_management.py)

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or a pull request. If you want to add a new resource, please have a look at the [`BaseResource` class](/reclaim_sdk/resources/base.py). The [`Task` class](/reclaim_sdk/resources/task.py) is a good example of how to implement a new resource. Reference the [Swagger Spec](https://api.app.reclaim.ai/swagger/reclaim-api-0.1.yml) for the available endpoints and also use the network tab in the browser to see the request and response payloads, as the Swagger Spec may not always be up-to-date or complete.
